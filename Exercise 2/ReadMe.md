#### Working with HSV Color Space, 15 Points)

1. Read the given oldtimer.png image. (1P)
2. Convert the color image to HSV color space, and create a grayscale version by retaining only the
value. (3P)
3. Think about another way to convert color image to grayscale. Its result should look reasonable
(with bright regions appearing bright), but it should differ from the one you obtained from the
HSV color space. Implement and briefly justify your method. (3P)
4. Output a version of the image in which saturation has been reduced by 50%. (2P)
5. Create a simple “aged photograph” effect by globally blending (via simple weighted averaging or
some other blend mode of your choice) the half-desaturated image from the previous step with
some amount of brown. (2P)
6. Rotate the hues of the original image so that the car obtains a different color. Provide two images
in which the car is blue, and has another color of your choice. (4P)
